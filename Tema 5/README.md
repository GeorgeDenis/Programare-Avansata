Homework (2p)
Represent the commands using classes instead of methods. Use an interface or an abstract class in order to desribe a generic command.
Implement the commands load, list, view, report (create the classes AddCommand, ListCommand, etc.).
list: prints the list of documents on the screen;
view: opens a document using the native operating system application (see the Desktop class);
report: creates (and opens) an HTML report representing the content of the catalog.
Use a template engine such as FreeMarker or Velocity, in order to create the HTML report.
The application will signal invalid data or the commands that are not valid using custom exceptions.
The final form of the application will be an executable JAR archive. Identify the generated archive and launch the application from the console, using the JAR.
